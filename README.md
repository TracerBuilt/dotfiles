# TracerBuilt's dotfiles

I've recently begun working in Neovim, and have discovered a boat-load of personal preferences and useful plugins throughout the process.

Enclosed are my configuration files for Neovim & Kitty, primarily. Along with a few ancillary files I thought belonged here.

Feel free to steal whatever you like, I hope it helps someone else avoid spending as much time on this as I did.
